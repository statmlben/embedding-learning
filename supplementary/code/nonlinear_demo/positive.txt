cusack film choice hes brand name movies usually arent big moneymakers unassuming way hes kind genius pleasant common man looks charming semiarticulate blatherings become one likeable romantic leading men sure thing say anything cusack merged talents early tom hanks early jack lemmon despite fact nearly every character plays variation character schlumpy every man hes constantly enjoyable screen

historical epic genre almost banished hollywood early many critics scholars importantly film producers thing past something could attracted crowds era blackandwhite television noncgi special effects case dances wolves five years ago came man decided use energy talents actor producer director order revitalise particular genre case dances wolves awarded effort oscars name film braveheart name director main actor mel gibson plot chronicles life scottish warlord folk hero william wallace time english king edward longshanks played patrick mcgoohan almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants subjected ius primae noctis various forms humiliation oppression english knights although english killed father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played mel gibson doesnt care politics wants peaceful life new bride murron played catherine maccormack murrons death changes wallace takes arms together small dedicated band followers begins guerrilla campaign would systematically destroy almost every english garrison country time people join ranks wallaces ragtag army scores surprising victory english knights battle stirling bridge newly freedom endangered internal squabbles scots especially nobles pretender robert bruce played angus macfadyen wouldnt like simple commoner national leader braveheart second film directorial career mel gibson wouldnt fair compare better known genre classics directed david lean anthony mann however even apply criteria braveheart decent historical epic takes new refreshing approach genre noticeable element approach naturalism older hollywood films set medieval europe used give fairytalelike vision picturesque castles splendid costumes knights shining armour gibson shows us extremely unpleasant world poverty feudal injustice might made right life hard short brutish general unpleasantness especially underlined scenes battle handtohand combat naturalistically displayed gory details never seen since verhoevens ultranaturalistic flesh blood compared naturalistic approach old hollywood epics look like stage plays braveheart also employs humour right places make bloody realities medieval british isles bearable sensitive audiences also underline downtoearth atmosphere different previous historical epics makes braveheart larger life protagonist mel gibson obviously invested plenty energy talent bringing mythical figure william wallace result character century poems transformed superhuman resembles late century comic book hero wallace superior enemies physically mentally yet able show sensitive vulnerable side naturally character based epic poems historical accuracy going drain case almost every historical epic hollywood however even dont particularly care history willing give poetic license scriptwriter randall wallace might think went top idolising wallace especially second part film scottish superhero manages seduce princess isabel played sophie marceau make child disbelief hardly suspended final scenes arent effective mel gibson actor truly wonderful also helped small army good british irish actors memorable patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated evil medieval monarch one effective villains seen contemporary cinema brendan gleeson would later become famous role boormans general also good wallaces trusted companion well ian bannen effective leprosystricken king john balliol david oharra entertaining wallaces irish ally angus macfadyen brings lot anxiety consciencestricken character robert bruce women film rather thankless roles especially marceau onedimensional french princess catherine mccormack wallaces wife interesting eliminated picture early technical point view film also good photography john toll brings lot scottish natural beauty screen hand musical score james horner employs much modernday instruments period piece set medieval times although mostly welcomed critics audiences alike braveheart often criticised homophobia forms extreme conservatism main reason fact gibson among many historical facts chose faithful related sexual orientation longshank son prince edward played peter hanly presented villain also one less competent villains camp portraying homosexuals villains inferior heterosexuals almost unforgivable sin politically correct hollywood make things even obvious good guys film total opposite effeminate incompetent edward rugged macho men mountains practical efficient tend employ conservatives common sense instead fashionable theories ivory tower liberals however although message film might look rightwing owes leftist ideology various national liberation movements century according ideology oppressed classes workers peasants better suited fight national freedom members less lose struggle radical less willing make compromises efficient hand privileged classes aristocracy bourgeoisie likely betray cause freedom cahoots foreign oppressors order keep privileges marxist worldview presented braveheart without subtlety end whether audience patient enough discover hidden meanings simply wants enjoy entertaining historical epic braveheart adequate choice fans recently

common many cases complaint francis ford coppolas masterpiece godfather glamorising mafia presented institution guided ancient tradition virtues like honour loyalty solidarity suitable gentler kinder ages martin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted perspective downtoearth vision mafia mean streets movie dealt lower echelons organised crime unfortunately scorsese film unspectacular artsy compete coppolas influence mafia portrayals movies seventeen years later scorsese returned mean streets new york another film dealt darker side american organised crime film goodfellas epic black comedy today considered one best influential films goodfellas owes initial success popularity fact based true story told bestseller book wiseguy nicholas pileggi would cowrite screenplay film book well film chronicled thirty years life henry hill played ray liotta irishitalian criminal new york age gets recruited criminal organisation paulie cicero played paul sorvino local mob boss gradually climbs ladder starting small errands couple years together best childhood friend tommy de vito played joe pesci joins crew expert thieves led jimmy conway played robert de niro three spend years best friends associates gathering enormous wealth criminal enterprises would culminate one spectacular robberies american history wealth influence privileges men connected mafia enough henry hill seduce future wife karen played lorraine bracco would afterwards remain loyal husband despite infidelities domestic abuse arrests would even accomplice private drug dealing business perfect world wiseguys gradually begins fall apart tommys unpredictable outbursts homicidal violence jimmys reluctance share part loot partners finally henrys drug habit would lead downfall make question loyalty friends goodfellas excellent example film represents work film genius full glory scorsese managed create vision effective complete despite full contradictions would ripped film apart hands less talented filmmaker world depicted film ordinary fascinating scorsese spares effort show us violence hypocrisy inherent paranoia organised crime yet manages make seductive funny exposed two half hours film three decades criminal history based notorious real life events audience understands characters chose dangerous life paths trading superficial shortlasting glamour prosperity criminal dullness poverty honest citizens scorsese also manages break viewers moralistic inhibitions showing truly revolting material scenes depict personal tragedies broken homes human depravity violence bloodshed murder uncompromising reality manner would make amusing funny audience use ironic soundtrack manipulative shots characters dialogue narrators commentary goodfellas represents new standards black humour would became popular years later tarantino era even dont pay attention skills potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing entertaining admit scorsese displays talents truly original creative filmmaker first might notice unusual structure plot relatively minor subplot used movies ironic prologue instead single narrator scorsese switches second character narrator middle film switch back original shortly afterwards multiple points views terms narration various subjective shots lengthens ironic distance towards characters situation ironic distance comes extremely effective choice soundtrack nostalgia good old times illustrated easylistening pop songs depression paranoia bad times find expression neurotic rock songs late soundtrack effective used ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tunes make strong ironic contrast scenes violence bloodshed however thing associated film couple continuos shots feature characters moving large rooms interacting dozens hundreds people scenes although require great skill patience shootings became popular among directors fragmentary character screenplay doesnt straight plot instead bases film series loosely connected vignettes gives another interesting opportunity scorsese uses structure film experiment successful experiments hilarious day life segment near end film another essential element goodfellas large superb collection great acting talents respectable among robert de niro character happen quiet businesslike member criminal trio gets overshadowed two friends colleagues joe pesci deserved oscar supporting role homicidal psychopath tommy lines including adlibs probably represent memorable element film ray liotta although equally talented perhaps doesnt look best choice narrator nominal hero film liottas henry hill looks somewhat hollywoodised glamorous among bunch lowlevel street thugs liotta hand improves general impression realistic menacing portrayal drug addiction lorraine bracco hand effective believable karen hill wife gradually descends moral cesspool husband paul sorvino also effective patriarch mafioso among supporting cast memorable chuck low pestering smalltime gangster unknowingly digs grave combination clever sociological study black humour innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something truly great films could work art excellent popular entertainment time achievement also great influence future filmmakers cinematic gem deserves rightful place among best films

seen may crossgates cinema guilderland theater brother john theater rating excellent seats sound picture critics note review longest ive ever written still scratches surface id recommend read seen film form critical analysis friend fellow film critic ted prigge said review phantom menace even write review never mind fact ive waiting new star wars movie since seven years old never mind fact everyone internet already dissected discussed movie even released never mind theres much going movie terms plot action special effects longterm story analyze every aspect would take lot time energy still wouldnt cover everything also like ted reviews ill try review way different usual reviews instead write casually possible talking directly reader begin analyzing specific aspects film many general significant factors must considered get specifics film skip next four paragraphs made obvious last several years another trilogy films produced account missing initial three installments star wars series first films actually episode four one george lucas creator series probably assumed people know firstproduced trilogy star wars empire strikes back return jedi actually second trilogy chronologically media interviews past explained movies made order cant recall reasons new film writer director also assumed viewers least vaguely familiar storylines significant plot points first trilogy err second trilogy well know mean order review thorough many significant points must mentioned unfortunately may serve spoilers proceed caution critics note one personal policy intentionally analyze spoilers would like reviews able make sense reader viewing film reviewed would nearly impossible film justice without breaking rule critics note reviewing film also breaks universal critics law reviewing movies roger ebert coined movie many outside factors come play films plot significance part trilogy considering modern society would difficult impossible simply review film completely autonomous story first catalog know film even going know young anakin skywalker grow become evil ruler darth vader also father luke skywalker lead successful revolution empire know obiwan ben kenobi trainer anakin ways force attempts become jedi knight would fail thus anakin would fall dark side also know something force kind universal force determines fate manipulated whose minds expanded enough believe feel jedi dont know sure history ruling galaxy likely much longer complex government earth one fascinating aspects first three films seemed subtle definite order complexity also seems supposed familiar details story come thousands comic books paperbacks published years since movies ended notably details regarding emperor empire jedi senator last name palpatine havent kept star wars paraphernalia years still way know details simply recognizing actor voice least phantom menace first chapter long saga one would assume basic groundwork would laid including history behind major factors series especially force jedi knights unfortunately film opposite simply builds top must history long detailed could never explained didnt liked aspect film one reasons falls short greatness youre going tell story beginning tell beginning possible trilogy complete could another trilogy episodes clarify back story even digress ive said much yet havent even touched specifics film necessary disclaiming elements go show vast story star wars series individual film get movie unlike three weve come know love since late similarity films helps keep spirit series familiar time seems flaw filmmaking process since sometimes rings unoriginality basic story rather sorted complex even confusing times told army known trade federation set blockade around seemingly insignificant planet called naboo given many details clarify back story federation purpose instead film opts get story moving quickly introduced two jedi master quigon jinn neeson apprentice obiwan kenobi mcgregor two acting ambassadors sort hopes ending obvious hostility federation planets queen amidala portman leader federation alien called viceroy following orders strange mythical character older human man whose face body covered shadowed black robe hood wears referred lord sidious considering appearance especially creepy evil voice obviously one significant characters series sidious communicates viceroy digital transmissions never person clearly actual whereabouts something wants keep secret would also reveal identity never openly revealed film clear viewers feeling well delve background next two films doesnt take film long spring action within minutes hero jedi fighting lives films story begins move along film doesnt one specific plot works manner films series get one miniplot adventure top another many miniplotswithinplots film would describe gives movie hook films relied type storytelling limits technology time films screenplays also limiting sense limitlessness gives phantom menace unique traits already know film takes place least generation two original star wars trilogy means lot background unclear andor unexplained may cleared beginning vast epic story significant storyline involving discovery anakin skywalker lloyd quigon jinn introduction jedi council briefly summarize story jinn stumbles upon skywalker attempt buy parts queen amidalas spaceship damaged efforts free federation meeting tatooine mostly chance course jinn chalks force jinn feel skywalker great natural power force another subplot involving bet skywalker fantastic race enter details significance begin reveal also provides new elaboration explanation force never mentioned fact seems something important upsetting never mentioned element seriously undermines mystical aspect force transforms something physical scientific completely unnecessary films third act major significant elements become tied together rather familiar execution plot funny reality star wars world seems embedded mythology new agelike philosophy religion yet solution major conflicts series violence technique hasnt used movies reallife situations countless times throughout history least spirit ultimate powers good versus evil fun exciting matter border cartoonish sometimes thats film appealing inner child basic reason entire saga exists become big part modern society phantom menace delivers exactly youd expect star wars film succeeds well always never truly achieves greatness many things film weve seen done heart filmmakers concentrated bit story character limited film far bad least embraces spirit sheer fun

much wanted like film went pleased left first getting usual lines newspaper glitz liked scream youll love wild things campbell gives stunning performance twisty plot dazzled days oh yeah day newspaper uses day neve campbell falls love onto serious stuff film mean nearly sarcastic way wild things singlehandedly broken rules surrounding rating mpaa im saying bad way see film may shocked see however perhaps mpaa pleased films charming cast tricky plot let film slide rating mormon im bound hear uproar religious zealots warning see film trouble already seen like wild things film noir filled sensibilities yet breaking rules modernday taboos culture style filmed rich color actors gorgeous people seemingly drawn gene pool placed film sure good true aint fun watch movies like come along sort better version basic instinct bound people either love hate people dont want admit liking see tell anyone sees like wild things begins blue bay high school one high school world teenager would love get almost students put entrance exams admittance totally based looks alone course select may look slightly ugly compared average person gorgeous immediately film finds tone audience settles enjoyable time turn brains right wrong may expecting one thing happen certainly doesnt turn way film begins classroom nearly main characters present theres sam lombardo matt dillon counselor students hes heading class discussion theres also kelly van ryan denise richards snobby rich teen fallen love sam teaching class however two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon gloria perez daphne rubinvega want talk sex cheers crimes boos sex crime ray asks gettin one student responds pretty much sets tone film watch however upon hearing one student suzie toller neve campbell stands leaves room commenting kiss part body wild things sets motion quickly kelly begins hitting sam sam doesnt want anything advances kelly stubborn continues pursue even pleads let wash jeep surprisingly thats really tell plot would give away one many crucial plot twists whats plot twists actually unpredictable going along way scream wild things maintains films surprises adds even plot twists film probably ever seen even though think may get tired surprises genuine rather pleasing going back mind nearly work though stretch boundaries belief thankfully convoluted plot doesnt give us much time think one pouncing yet another twist us shock previous one worn critics complain film trashywell pretty much one trashy film however kind trashy isnt hard watch good trash sense one screenplay knows taken seriously includes lot humor satire story varies everywhere kellys mother theresa russell caricature rich people way ambulancechasing lawyer bill murray wears neckbrace cover insurance scam running bill murray also provides best character film genuine laughs two sex gratuitous although unwelcomed wild things supposed sex film title wouldnt movie breaks boundaries instead heterosexual sex scenes also includes lesbian scenes denise richards neve campbell dont worry graphic might think heterosexual scenes quite graphic surprise shocker kevin bacons fullfrontal nude scene brief blink may miss ahem long remember dont think seen rrated film show erect one completely judging audiences reaction expected also one scene late film seemed relationship brewing bacon dillons characters nothing came makes wonder director cut order rating actors refused first made want see wild things cast neve campbell course one favorite actresses since scream films released however turns every typical role done head plays gothic pothead closest role performance craft though even nice girl campbell probably best film shows wide range talent tell around long time denise richards also around long time although may limited roles without much range gets express emotions stiff yet effective performance starship troopers hopefully one day land good role display ability daphne rubinvega newcomer movies gives good performance although character mostly left background first hour half towards end get bigger part male side matt dillon probably best giving subtle performance surprises every twist kevin bacon slightly wooden character makes must admiration though screen judging many womens reactions theater shot grown deeper appreciation bacon yeah right bill murray performance comic relief nearly steals film whole entire cast works wondrously together seem home even menage troi director john mcnaughton previously done critically acclaimed henry portrait serial killer constructed wonderfully twisty plot works direction smooth stylish visuals striking filled rich colors almost realistic actually breathe humidity air however seems home actors arent talking flyby shots swampy areas brilliant photography denise richards climbing pool highlight cinematography gorgeous details often see film like watch see camera take pictures music probably obvious thing set perfect mood film hard describe words see film listen wonderfully composed presented sure stick around closing credits mcnaughton finally put ending credits good use comedies use outtakes included small scenes help explain preceding events may say lame attempts explain convoluted plot entertaining way finish film plus shocking moments ending credits add fun wild things appropriately rated strong sexuality nudity language violence nudity rather unnecessary lets face itpeople want see give neve campbell admirably nonudity clause contract see behind takes top way go neve sex scenes graphic especially first one see mother one deck hands one almost wonders got away rating language quite harsh ranging sexual innuendo average everyday profanity cant stress enough dont allow kids see film target age movie range thats see definitely mention film rated however get chance watch probably likely pleased may even take friends see next time

wake smashing success rumble bronx looking likely jackie chan films see american release rumor one films drunken master ii version copy laserdisc widescreen bilinguallysubtitled hong kong films days availability united states limited films must either purchased via pirates sought asian distributors tai seng subtitling copy slightly hard read letters white bit small although american release almost certainly dubbed review subtitled version please keep mind youre reading review help decide whether go see fair must admit ive never fond periodpiece martial arts moviesthe ones set nebulous china distant distant past perhaps ive seen filmed inferior stock either butchered dubbing allbutillegible subtitling perhaps plots tend similar many cases nonexistant fact many get wrapped subplots seem forget main plot entirely minutes end matter might jackie chan films modern settings armour god rumble bronx etc tend spectacular stunts often involving large motor vehicles large explosions whereas period pieces simply martial arts said must turn right around say drunken master ii remarkable exception one better martial arts films ive seen quite enjoyed surprised well drunken master ii young man named wong feihong played jackie chan master drunken boxing style kung fu learned style uncertain father wong keiying ti lung steadfast opposition feihongs practicing rather normal style kung fu apparently feihong sort figure chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan americans ive heard little could quite well wrong ill leave analysis people know better one friends points character wong feihong also featured upon time china movies yet seen plot drunken master ii somewhat hazy plots many films youre watching jackie chan film odds arent expecting something order war peace story seems revolve around evil foreigners spiriting away ancient chinese relics hence chinas cultural heritage overworking underpaying beating chinese workers nearby steel mill however plot merely serves framework main story filmfeihongs perpetual struggle win girlfriend supplicate father keep pregnant mother played anita mui fighting keep getting beaten evil foreigner thugs macguffin drives plot precious antique jade imperial seal taken away evil foreigners beginning feihong accidentally steals trying recover identicallywrapped box containing medicinal ginseng father bringing back customer process clashes another thief trying seal ends instead ginseng feihong narrowly avoids getting caught seal evil foreigners lackies thanks timely intervention generals son cameo appearance andy lau would later take starring role drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back wong household feihong mother attempt come replacement missing ginseng goes plot thickens later feihongs girlfriend maneuvers kung fu match rival feihong thief revealed loyalist manchu officer trying recover seal stop evil foreigners attacked en masse another grand kungfu movie tradition think ive already spent time plot really deserves lets move real draw jackie chan movies action theres plenty martial arts action found movie course kung fu film thats expected however isnt another kung fu movie one jackie chan fight stunt choreography jackie chan genius primary martial arts style featured film drunken boxing form kung fu attempts draw adversary guard making seem like fellow using drunk purposes film least drunken boxers fight better actually intoxicated theres fine line drunk enough drunk stupor normal circumstances idea someone staggering around looking sloshed managing fight effectively even incredibly might seem rather stupid jackie pulls flair kung fu sequences intricate staging execution pointless try describe paper ill say fightsespecially big climactic fight endin make movie worth watching another thing drunken master ii going stunt work even without motor vehicles well counting train remarkable stunts film among things jackie dives balcony table crawls across hot coals least twice count outtake shown credits quicktime movies stunts found www movie database unlike american films stunts faked drunken master ii stars several veteran actors hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung better tomorrow anita mui heroic trio series rumble bronx performances firstrate especially comes comedy parts film scene feihong mother conspire literally behind feihongs fathers back cover missing ginseng root hilarious scene feihongs mother revealed pregnant threatening hurt order draw husbands anger away feihong jackie developed knack physical comedy sort mastery years hes fine form drunken master ii far cinematography concerned certainly works film nothing spectacular least dozen times better old kung fu movies picture crisp clear one thing find particularly worthy mention least copy screen wider film ive ever seen videotape beforealmost whole screen blocked watch bigscreen tv movie theater utter shame film eventually panandscanned american video release drunken master ii shows full potential period piece kung fu movies good enough overcome even usual distaste movies plot meander bit thats expected type film like kind movie youll love movie well give chance anyway

many people find much like dreams may come new film visionary director vincent ward come see computer animated landscapes vibrant colors little know plainly found quite complex story tell walking theater could see audiences disgust one member even awakened film ended dont believe previews see definitely film everyone quite possibly one adultoriented films come recent years kids get bored slow plotting complex storyline plot fluid heaven ward presents us goes back forth time boundaries think film city angels add complex screenplay unique vision films deal afterlife doubt dreams may come well box office costing around million make film would extremely well order make money back due story doubt everyone thought titanics story simple cliche proof james cameron written complex screenplay may done nearly well dont get wrong hope film well vision pure visceral enjoyment hardly ever gets put screen doubt us could thought place even mind dreams may come second best film year comes visuals film surpasses dark city full rich shocking colors get see heaven us would probably die get dont youll end going hell dreams may come begins two boats colliding lake chris christy nielsen robin williams startled sudden jolt even startled beauty woman boat annie annabella sciorra spies chris well eventually bond get married annie artist whose paintings colorful lush surrealistic chris doctor loves annie life also two children marie jessica brooks ian josh paddock one day two children killed car crash almost destroys annie tries commit suicide fails put institution chris copes problem realizing arent around anymore nothing change annie gets life back order chris killed trying save life car crash victim chris goes heaven version heaven rather guided albert cuba gooding jr chris explores new surroundings pure delight joy realizes miserable without annie prior heaven would try comfort annie around pain felt chris decides leave alone little realize happen next im say plot point crucial rest story many critics however give away certainly chris dying crucial plot tell dies previews story necessarily important movie work deals afterlife however strangely virtually nothing heard god devil couple comments story maintains focus chris search love life soul mates chris exclaims heaven movies almost always depicted glowing city white purity love usually also looks like rests among clouds dreams may come goes different route shows us heaven us never seen chris heaven memories brought life thoughts make anything real makes paintings annie drew become heaven ive never seen anyone use real paint albert says equally good depictions hell cast away normal stereotypes fire brimstone instead state one gloriously horrific scene chris tracker max von sydow arrive sea faces thousands heads stuck ground bodies somewhere else mostly dead silent quips made almost lighten mood truly frightening sequence production designer eugenio zanetti definitely going oscar nomination using state art computer technology worlds created exploration sometimes scenes play visual impact necessary appreciate seeing costume designer yvonne blake also appears film done incredible job providing interesting colorful costumes cinematographer eduardo serra whose work last seen luscious wings dove difficult job cinematographers working special effects serras entire universe computer generated image masterful job writer ron bass adapting novel richard matheson provides fluid screenplay real set plot story extremely vague details allowing viewers think meaning director vincent ward puts together final vision dreams may come good example german expressionism may turn good portion audience average movie goer likely isnt used expressionistic techniques film also definitely draw attention religious people shouldnt take far movie robin williams continuously impressed dramatic performances comedic roles suffering comedy perfection makes stuff confined screenplay isnt quite effective drama really strong point see doubtful hell get another oscar nomination wouldnt really mind real surprise annabella sciorra impressed last year cop land may breakout role may garner much needed attention also quite possible could get oscar nomination however academy doesnt like award performances types films cuba gooding jr better hes certainly distracting max von sydow underused jessica brooks josh paddock treat movie goers see werner herzog appear even recognize chris father lost sea faces hard see herzog would attracted film considering thinks audiences starving great images overall williams sciorras film dreams may come rated thematic elements involving death disturbing images language partial nudity film definitely aimed adult audience find plot distracting find

people fit two different categories either love woody allen hate guts family part hates movies think hes funny shtick gotten forced contrived years maybe taking body away best decision producer could thought unrestrained physical boundaries allens humor comes shining problems physical appearance able join rest us laughing allens intelligent observations life problems verbal comedy may want skip one film introduced audiences sparked imaginations showed something theyd never seen toy story used stateoftheart computer technology presented world toys would come alive humans present many critics call better film believe say completely original motion picture antz however upped ante considerably disneys bugs life isnt due another two months dreamworks seems received better end deal beating disney satisfied audiences thirst computeranimated films dont let fool disney definitely scared past two years competitions broken studios volcano duel opinion dantes peak came way ahead predecessor time quality volcano original premise destroyed ridiculous situations twice many competing films first comet competition armageddon blew away cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact even interesting one beloved studio disney goes newcomer dreamworks prevail time tell im sure mr mouse nothing fear may sound like didnt like antz contrary id put toy story due pg rating many parents may put dialogue shouldnt appear disneys version dialogue antz pushes envelope familyoriented film sexual innuendoes profanity pop occasionally makes dreamworks animated feature geared adult crowd humor also written especially adults though many kids laughing theater attended type film made families often entertaining kids entertaining parents antz begins hilarious monologue seems meld woody allens shtick franz kafkas metamorphosis short story man wakes discover bug allen troubled ant believing made worker youre middle child family five million comments neglected childhood one night sitting bar friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing pathetic place life walks princess bala sharon stone one recognizes without crown bala asks would like dance engage pulp fictionesque dance everyone else following leader discovering princess falls love theres problem bala getting married general mandible gene hackman ruthless leader merely wants control better stronger colony order must eliminate queen anne bancroft weakest colony namely worker ants get rid queen needs get rid loyal army ants would willing die colonel cutter christopher walkin come plan send loyal ants battle surely killed queen reluctant first decides best colony meanwhile wants meet bala asks weaver army ant switch places gets sent battle manages survive slaughter termites battle sequence absolutely stunning though may flashbacks starship troopers contained similar sequence however antz film production around time similarities merely coincidence second half film revolves around zs kidnapping bala search mythical place called insectopia ant boss food wants adventures bala get surprisingly high tension especially one involving magnifying glass looming targets like spaceships independence day fact im going assume producers referenced intentionally ants look awe beam fire blasts ground visually exciting rush adrenaline dont fooled little kids shouldnt see may try copy seeing antz vowed never intentionally step ant hopefully children learn killing ants rather cruel animated film antz probably best find date visually stunning dreams may come best aspect animation fact characters arent limited gravity take ridiculous situations make seem plausible one great moment involves mass worker ants bunching form wrecking ball animation perfect virtually see every single ant ball however exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck bottom young boys shoe truly great example film making finest computer technology animators carefully made ants faces look similar actors providing voices best example would barbatus danny glover one point even see pores face although doubt ants pores barbatus also touching rather gruesome scene final words without body young kids may disturbed site dismembered head good deal humor derived appropriate adults course disneys bugs life looks good dont know able best dreamworks newest animated feature terms animation dreamworks done something studio could go head head big mouse knock yes anastasia good nearly good even worst disney vocal talent always essential animated feature antz one best lineups seen since toy story fact far exceeds one woody allen always funny transcends hes done past years without body comic timing noticeable thing fact im pretty sure writers let improvise lot lines sharon stone bala shows comic ability though part stone works best dramatic actress sylvester stallone teamed stone beginning solidify statement wants actor typecast action star snub oscars last year stallone proving serious comedic illustrated actor gene hackman superb grufftalking general almost another take crimson tide persona christopher walkin probably noticed voice many people remember hits batman returns anne bancroft minimal role shes effective nonetheless danny glover small role good job dan aykroyd jane curtin also lend voices two lovesick eurotrash beesboth unrecognizable especially aykroyd jennifer lopez plays worker ant falls love weaver although people wont recognize voice either many people recognize grant shauds voice foreman played miles tv show murphy brown definitely huge cast highprofile names definitely help grosses course probably tell lot million budget went also directors eric darnell lawrence guterman relative newcomers though guterman direct feature headless show incredible talent type picture tense times

international realm even spies countries limits cia long country hubbard therefore finds highly unusual agency spook nosing around considers territory two form tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes aware increasingly complicated series allegiances possibly illegal actions involving terrorism united states government original tagline patriot games never terrorist attack american

gets rather heady times credit screenwriters zwick lawrence wright menno meyjes dont underestimate intelligence audience dont know tone inflection something else denzel washington way spitting dialog makes whatever says sound great combined innate acting ability experience playing midlevel authority figure makes performance siege convincing enjoyable annette bening gives one assertive portrayals female character ive seen recently chemistry shares washington palpable somewhat unfortunate characters fortitude broken certain point allows us watch bening play little range bruce willis pretty much relegated toughguy role always standing straight permanent scowl fixed upon face however tension exists devereaux hubbard major drive behind films development notable tony shalhoub plays fbi agent frank haddad lebanese immigrant role calls evidencing kind filial pride heritage contempt race might interfere integration american society difficult say least shalhoub naturalness almost reach touch perhaps best known role antonio cab driver nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety dramatic abilities wonderful film big night whereas denzel washington seems edward zwicks favorite actor directed washington glory courage fire james horner seems favorite composer therefore found odd zwick chose prolific scorewriter graeme revell seven films year already horner siege realized film contained lot arabianthemed music horners record shown propensity scores either neutral ethnicity irishsounding revell good job providing appropriate music punctuate key scenes allowing score enhance movie whole nowhere near intrusive films weve getting throughout year missteps siege found couple excesses takes example pretty clear throughout film meant thriller action flick unfortunately theres scene army cuts loose arab immigrants blatant display firepower explosions obviously meant sole purpose eyecatching middle city real opposition zwick even army use cobra attack helicopter shoot rockets building farther feet friendly troops verisimilitude really goes window point film also gets little preachy toward end focusing ability different races get along noble gesture film puts message across bit obviously flaws glaring dont detract much otherwise good film makes think issues may considered since history class

people enjoy science fiction often faced unpleasant surprises due improper labelling novels stories comic books movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled science fiction pure fantasy supernatural horror rather simple technothriller cases mistakes understandable genre boundaries never clearly marked believe really cases movie labelled science fiction actually happens straight historical epic thing occurred former yugoslavia fifteen years ago national distributors gave treatment right stuff film directed philip kaufman mistake distributors could explained fact official poster film features men space suits right stuff film isnt even fiction based nonfiction book tom wolfe covering early years american space program plot film begins people heard edwards air force base major test site experimental planes major aim test flights determine ability manned aircraft reach mach speed thus break sound barrier many pilots tried achieve goal many paid lives bravado one quiet pilot chuck eager played sam shaped succeeds thus gives example whole new generation test pilots determined enter history books breaking new speed records ten years later soviets launched sputnik marking beginning space age order regain national prestige us government decides first send man space best air force navy marine pilots recruited program yeager lacks college education desired allamerican image one critics polls right stuff named one among top films made high position could explained fact kaufmans film looks quite atypical time three hours length epic scope looked suitable age hollywood used make films larger life real reason lies fact made truly remarkable talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation using opportunities golden age order create original memorable movies right stuff last swan song era producers allowed directors spend big bucks unusual risktaking artsy projects right stuff unusual lacks many standard elements hollywood film plot almost nonexistent coherent story featuring many interesting incidents anecdotes shifts focus old generation test pilots embodied yeager new generation astronauts film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager also appears small cameo remains true hero film equal time exposure also given astronauts wives making movie ensemble piece gave opportunity kaufman use multitude great acting talents specialised bit character roles sam shepard great yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech sound barrier remained obscured history books probably due modesty surface lacks personality compared hyped fortunate astronaut colleagues shepard gives texture character subtle gestures phrases shepards performance followed great acting ed harris cleancut marine future politician john glenn young dennis quaid fine arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper arrogance mirrored friend tragic figure virgil grissom superbly played fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides comic relief navy aviator arguably first american man space alan shepard kaufman left room female talents excel barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright mary jo deschanel great pilots wives royal dano also impressive menacing figure preacher memorable performances belong donald moffat vicepresident lyndon johnson jane dornacker nurse murch great acting talent assembled film mirrored kaufmans superb direction notable methods kaufman uses order suggest passage time beginning film shows test pilots living middle desert virtual unknowns far away strict rules discipline everything seems natural yeager indulge horse riding yards away fastest precious aircraft world setting quite normal important technical problems solved simple chainsaw test pilots report ribs broken important flights times changing alliance ussr replaced cold war natural pilots like yeager must replaced disciplined conventional pilots entire lives become focus media frenzy job subjected strict rules meticulous plans must fight bureaucrats publicityseeking politicians uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played scott beach preserve basic human dignity contrast underlined beautifully edited sequence yeager conducts final spectacular test flight absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame fortune although even going space contrasts similar effects achieved kaufmans superb use poetic movie language editing great photography caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like funeral desert astronauts suits walking slow motion image would copied many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support nasa american military provided authentic locations period equipment still use special effects order simulate space flights effects excellent still fool audience accustomed cgi real footage earth outer space another fine contribution film oscar awarded musical score bill conti still tremble excitement every time hear accompanied use holst debussy songs used background also provide authentic atmosphere historical period film great cult status well deserved minor flaws mercury astronauts arent fleshed enough although played fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure hand logical conclusion film landing moon would require film six hours long also critics prone attack film amerocentric hard russians portrayed evil monsters line virulent cold war rhetoric reagans america contemporary interviews kaufman defended approach claiming wanted make film authentic possible order portrayed russians real life perceived americans early time passed dont see astronauts heroes age widespread satellite communications routine space missions men women space suits seen mere maintenance workers young boys want astronauts grow film sentimental reminder times future began perhaps could encourage least follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers sky even decide stay earth could still appreciate right stuff

good long since good old fashioned thriller mostly everything goes right audience wrong characters even longer since saw thriller actually shock cared characters merely judged actually allowed human foibles flaws strengths emerge radiantly id saw least couple decades even far back great hitchcock thrillers though im hardly comparing simple plan say rear window strangers train yet almost good simple yet strangely complex astonishingly rewarding instead moving plot point plot point merely laying theymightbecaught overtones instead concerns moral corruption depths greed protagonists go without ever judging either evil even immoral elegantly directed sam raimi yes simple plan concerns discovery crashed plane within bag full millions dollars upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton dimwitted brother billy bob thornton drinking buddy brent briscoe without anyone around possibility one would come looking three debate debate finally reach decision yes keep authorities possible owners cash come looking generally dont flaunt anything dont want flaunt theyll keep stored away custody paxton possibilites circumstance much diverse could endlessly play cat mouse authorities could try fight rightful owners either villainous could fight amongst simple plan though borrows little little tiff cops subplot involving alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole bit inside feuding austin powers would say thats necessarily bag baby admired film makes far superior unique thriller successfully able cake eat effectively involves traditional thriller cliches like ones mentioned time involves deeply way characters become morally corrupt price pay think happiness black duffle bag steps taken neatly cover things subsequent steps go miserably awry film choses never loose sight covering things extent characters slowly losing souls humanity one early scene paxton thornton make trip back plane return money doesnt look like stolen bad idea thornton screws continuously throughout movie paxton major coveringup read homicide instead quick murder immeadiate handswashing raimi shows lengthy painful shot lowangle onto paxtons face tries sift emotions reach conclusion theres similar shot afterwards paxton watching murder hes committing taking horror also wonderfully effective previous shot even better morally complex gutwrenching short probably best piece direction raimis ever done demonstrating sometimes simplest way something yields best results proof watch persona sex scene witness may best scene ingmar bergmans ever done film hardly stops follows completely rarely loses sight characters humanity depletion thereof yet also moves step step graceful method never feel like film merely stamping plot points story time comes paxton start becoming selfish thus diabolical aid pregnant wife played bridget fonda pal raimi soon horror situation escalating tragic heights theres least two grand shootouts least one may one greatest shootouts cinema history arrive dont come masochistic delight cringeinducing horror one actually sinking chair mantra cant streeming head fact film getting many comparisons coens superior forget fargo many similar moments manic insanity attributed major amount subtlety restraint directors direct hands would overthetop distractedness imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing seeing evil dead films id hardly assume raimi would able pull something like although moments film easily dubbed raimi moments rifleshot notwithstanding instead raimi directs maturity gentle touch easily letting story characters coexist still letting traditional raimi elements come like offbeat comic touches particularly billy bob thorntons character jacob brilliant creation dimwittedness often hilarious film every line uttered greeted howling laughter theres authenticity performance strangely enough makes sure totally laughing chuckles gets necessarily ones fullcondescension thornton damn real jacobs multidimensional character stupid see much flaw strength character simplicity endearing many acts commits strong inner strength belief system primarily towards middle bud coconspirator begins make heavy waves concerning money final third film spends much time many touches upon character thornton also screenwriter scott smith adapting book way great particularly admired back story old high school girlfriend told thornton sincerity acception cruel story reversed nearsweetness strength saddened character thornton absolutely brilliant performance far best performance hes ever given proof hes best character actor contemporary cinema dont believe go back watch wonderful performance primary colors performance would nominated oscar hadnt year hes easily able slip character make completely utterly believable brings much weight film character actors difficult picturing anyone else role rest cast great paxtons declining working man chelcie ross amiable town sheriff even fonda shows talents nicely complaints film plot almost simplistic times seems much like exercise like cruel test humanity still pays attention humanity involved occasional narration usually annoying narration used extreme caution especially youre trying set things andor express emotions didnt raimi watch first murder scene thing usually go wrong movie ending basically amiss wont reveal way cruel much outsider setup appearance plane wasnt already much anyway film deals much intimately humanity characters involved wrong ending imagine charactercontrolled ending otherwise like crime punishment police caught instead breaking confessing im comparing simple plan dostoevsky ending work despite protestations something incessantly nagging unsatisfying qualms happy clam ignore go day despite mere claims make mistake completely utterly edge seat throughout even sometimes curdling situations occured kind gore factor thankfully minimal film places characters situations gives painful things overcome ive

actually fan original liveactiondisney flick name starring hayley mills twice pair twins separated birth divorcing parents never come contact parents never meet everyone know feel remakes especially films happen enjoy fallacy unless youre going either capture exact spirit original something different maybe even wrack brain come gasp new idea remake originally top viewing list actually quite opposite contemporary liveactiondisney films one favorties anyway theyre usually unfunny alienating big fat bore least anyone age iq one however shockingly bad fact actually good original good whats great doesnt necessarily retread original capture exact spirit become entertaining exact reasons original entertaining cute innocent fun pretty killer plot endlessly fun follow along lead star immensely appealing parents also immensely appealing im repeating cute innocent fun theres nothing risque save plot idea separating twins denying truth years ominously selfish precisely point movie aimed directly either kids adults want remember original young adults want remember like kid personally somewhere second third vividly remember taste movies wasnt weird diverse names godard kubrick werent even glimmer right eye back would tune every sunday night couple years see abcs wonderful world disney theyd show liveaction andor madefortv disney flick hour per week remember mom taking sister along friends mothers see rereleased disney films like lady tramp pinnochio sadly remember every single christmas without fail barage childrens animated halfhour shows made exclusively christmas season wouldnt dare missing even remember seeing madefortv parent trap ii tv one night seen one saw original parent trap late childhood movie deals issue divorce deals disneyized version playful witty charming saw first time right never experienced part childhood id probably dismiss id probably new version movie hadnt seen original perfect age watching could remember fun watch disney film divorce started get thinking possibilities seeminglyperfect parents splitting affected adolescence also brushed fear smooth stroke pointed even fuckedup situations things could always work well manipulate things bit least better new version also charming way new cast contemporary feel first time awhile liveactiondisney flick tone isnt corny condescending right moments would otherwise seem corny actually affecting safe kind way first time since original film kids actually know better foolish adults story basically classic repeated almost many times kurosawas seven samurai pair twins played lindsay lohan like played hayley mills original separated birth divorcing parents one annie sent live mother natasha richardson resembling mother vanessa redgrave ever noticed london lives parents devoted foppish butler simon kunz works swingin fashion designer grows refined classy also keen knowledge sports pokerplaying hallie sent northern california father dennis quaid live vineyard pseudomaid lisa ann walter grows rugged yet charming meet camp one annie wants go become rugged feud look alltoo similar thus tight competition results nasty pranks winds seclusion together private outoftheway cabin become friends learn eachother know everything concoct scheme switch places one meet parent theyve heard learn eachothers lives detail make sure look alike requires hair cutting notoriously earpiercing scene like kiddie version hypodermic needle scene pulp fiction end summer comes switch hope best lindsay lohan doesnt necessarily copy acting style hayley mills original comes appealing though add couple new things makes california twin little appealing london twin bit frank snobbish snotty proper original respectively also adds american british accent one one faking accent throughout really take notice see fake ones accents arent exactly perfect shes also incredibly appealing merely cute especially notable since first feature film know notorious child actors especially first films makes great protagonist helps supporting cast equally appealing dennis quaid fact hasnt likable decade big dumb smile near cocky attitude made notable actor past hes mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except hasnt ever likable period two make winning couple maybe winning maureen ohara late brian keith original still work film instead bickering ensued original film adds another dimension another angle characters amiss original opening credits see glimpses courtship fall quickly madly love eachother back together films smarmy scenes come actually sentimental great way migraineinducing way many films brings new parent trap level entertainment hasnt really existed since well original film years ago still money best liveactiondisney flick time form intelligence wit makes plot points otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot golddigging sharon stone type played elaine hendrix whos deliciously tormented twins later film treat instead bore like original film transcends crap well could case point takes two starring olsen twins treats children smart ones adults silly ones way around everything knows exactly charming without biting chew however comparison original could bit better certain scenes work well nearly well worked original liked way parents fought past dilemnas fought falling love better liked watching two old flames getting back together bottle wine somehow feuding always cinematic pleasing mere reminscing lesson extracted howard hawkscary grant films yesteryear much film transcends mere cutedom compared original film almost drowns cutedom original though gritty far stylized suitable adult audiences young audiences remake may never nearly great classic original film least knows treat source material dignity respect create virtually effects without bordering plagerism petty annoyances

since movies slavery shield us true horrors theyre portraying fitting say beloved come real shock film confusing bizarre tough film watch film ive seen year thats necessarily threehour running time beloved challenging watch filled tough powerful poetry takes us completely guard instead straightforward hollywoodized story happened slaves freed beloved comes cry anguish actually lived happened rather toni morrison wrote novel upon based beloved tells story exslave named sethe played oprah winfrey lives large farm north children film opens house terrorized poltergeist shakes things wounds dog makes things generally uncomfortable family sethe proud though move sons run away leaving daughter denver kimberly elise alone ghost without factual explanation couple years pass ghost remains one day man named paul danny glover another exslave knew sethe years ago worked plantation together arrives asking lodging wandering around since left plantation enters house turns red becomes incredibly hot remarks thinks evil sethe replies aint evil sad time passes paul become fervent member household ghost disappears return one day going discover young woman sitting house name beloved played thandie newton almost zero motor skills stumbles around halfgrabbing onto things knocking speaks lets low guttural sound eventually turns baby talk let house begins turn things upside beloved acts like incredibly difficult chamber drama paired ghost story scenes consist people arguing one claustrophobic lowlit room occasional flash past see images horror thank god modernday psychoanalysts sethe paul lived hellish times forever implanted memories slavehood old plantation includes images sethe raped white plantation hands nipples licked prompting cry paul reminiscing took milk worst month freedom allowed live like free person working blacks farm seeing old plantation owners arrived presumedly take children back runs barn near carrying four children old owners burst discover murdered one ready murder rest dont leave alone inquired moment paul moment halfway film says doesnt regret killed daughter would live horror convinced right thing course beloved really daugher materialized though arent flat told later film beloved represents pain suffering slaves went shows difficult deal freedom tortured long thus beloved becomes sortaredux andrei tarkofsky scifi classic solaris cosmonaut discovers wife commited suicide years materialized orbiting planet complex brain system film spoke volumes humanity memories constantly regretting happened past ever literally came back haunt us would control us completely beloved moves along freely without lot explanation part extremely respectable interesting films ones dont explain everything us leaving gaps characters supposed fill act present tense sethe never fully explained character understand actions since shes played oprah winfrey well decade since last major performance color purple judging two films ill bet shes one best actresses working today strictly actress talk show suppose great entity prevented becoming noteworthy actress thats shame brings much movie emotion sadness strength watching strong sethe whos afraid past shes built rather strong protective coating around break discovers beloved really makes movie really great makes real thats say perfect film fact id wager say fact confusing painful watch prevents truly great film oprahs performance powerful easily sympathetic im dying see win least oscar nomination february structure film doesnt show happened children till halfway film prevents us really making cohesive connection film doesnt necessarily move though theyre memories one particular character end lost control sethe takes bed unable truly identify anymore despite tediousness perhaps thats point distancing end film may part way built start since figure crossed identifiable needs get back reality part film seems like cry pain slaves really wants jonathan demmes direction bizarre nature story creates right mood making tough film sit making sure audience feels uncomfortable characters theres admire like way flashbacks pop freely without real organization like would real life way ending leaves somewhat open pain suffering laced touch optimism acting winfrey amazing anticipate get oscar nomination everyone raving thandie newtons performance rewarded however must noted everyone easiest part act like baby throw things stumble around chew food mouth open think theres another performance worthy oscar conisderation kimberly elise daugher stay sensible sane carry burden mothers loss reality towards end newton isnt great shes annoying wacky role demands elise tougher job pulls even better despite fact film winfrey written writer morrison director demme beloved still done well costing think around ninety million dollars since grossed twentytwo unfortunately film little intense viewers even stand almost anything recently viewed hour long epic caligula worst film ever seen life mere sittings although respect beloved cant say really enjoyed

woody allens films almost never rely visual flair textual flair one films closely resembles one time two entities fit handinhand manhattan really one bestlooking films ive ever seen beautiful black white photography citys best areas etc fan cant help feel visibly moved film opens usual credits plain white font black backgrounds old ironic standard playing soundtrack screen fills gorgeous dull gray sky word help spelled airplane beethovens blasts soundtrack city seems stop take notice moment rather lovely look cut film crew shooting films hilariously banal key moment film lead actress film melanie griffith looking buxom beautiful ever realize somethings wrong life whatever terribly stale scene woody allen film great opening shots without heart sank soon got used fact new film going great past works though record last years deconstructing harry came awfully close hell happened man could relied neurotic freshness cinema become less funny films become less insightful like tossed together unfinished ideas bullets broadway though wonderful relies irony pull farce never totally takes mighty aphrodite full great moments lines really great story everyone says love great idea great film even deconstructing harry admittingly cheap way even top one truly hilarious films anything reception celebrity everyone tip allen fact time audience critics wrong wonderful film celebrity yes good film marginally satisfying woody allen film instead creating great woody allen world hes created world subject knows bit hes fashioned film based almost entirely uninformed philosophy celebrities plays like series skits minor connections like la dolce vita without accuracy right amount wit correct personal crisis woody becoming insecure old age choses drop woody allen character world celebrities hang flaws scrutiny casting brit actor kenneth branagh lead much said performance dead irritating makes one yearn real thing blah blah blah anyone actually knows woody allen character knows branaghs performance though featuring mannerisms stuttering whining lots hand gestures hardly wartsandall impersonation branagh brings along little woody allen charm actually allows characters flaws apparent woodys flawed guy know love anyway hes really funny really witty really intelligent branaghs allen bit flatout bad charm yes like still sure hes really good person character lee simon first seen set aforementioned movie hits extra actress winona ryder goes interview griffith takes childhood home makes pass denies sorta learn flashbacks lee sucked trying celebrity thanks midlife crisis appearance high school reunion since quit job travel journalist become gossip journalist sorts covering movie sets places celebrities congregate meet maybe sell script bank robbery movie deep personal crisis divorced wife several years allen regular judy davis continues quest sexual happiness boucing girlfriend girlfriend fling fling course film griffith comes escapades model charlize

national status lee fumbling selfishly trying ensure happiness davis becomes happy ive become kind woman ive always hated im loving without thing result film highs mediums mediums take film sitations scenes dont exactly work cant help pat allen back trying places really great scenes opening sequence theron good wished hadnt ended banana scene bebe neuwirth droll ever perhaps best sequence romp

tyrannical totally heartbreaking lee comes talk script read finds wild allday ride go atlantic city watch fight gamble wind hotel room darrow gets flame gretchen mol lends one leftover groupies allens writing scenes good id almost recommend film almost really liked film despite fact mess despite fact film really needs good old fashioned rewrite allen still smart insightful film though jokes either stale misplaced seem cartoonish even environment allen still manages get across film exactly celebrities may seem itd extremely outoftouch want celebrities equate celebrityhood happiness never get close enough actual celebrities see theyre really happy may appear surface get close enough lee davis character lee obsessed phenomenon davis takes arms length never gets involved soon becomes one

alien alien film seen theaters saw years old must admit didnt like course expecting aliens believe fault order appreciate alien need see aliens also wipe away expectations predecessor james camerons aliens action film many people consider best series among group alien extremely entertaining film critics bashed originality many thought final chase scene went long many others thought film much dialogue enough action untrue film quite bit action dialogue essential wellwritten chase sequence long overly long creating quite bit suspense confusion perhaps watching alien video helped big screen overwhelmed something normally didnt see dark film language extremely harsh always figured alien series rely smart dialogue instead moronic profanities dont get wrongim saying films eliminate swearing film substitutes dialogue profane remarks gets rather distracting however since seeing realize swearing mainly aspect restrained hatred characters result alien flaw albeit major one underdeveloped characters never really care get feeling many scenes cut order shorten length movie two characters liked course one lt ripley sigourney weaver although gotten know two films character dr clemens charles dance like inevitable occurs alien begins exactly aliens left prologue alien pure cinematic achievement director david fincher directed music videos chance alien entry without using single line dialogue unless count computer warnings fincher sets entire film impressive aspect fincher shows seconds film cutting title card see lt ripley little girl cryogenic compartments title shot alien egg title alien legs stretch air title first ten minutes learned everything order alien proceed quite remarkable opening one remain mind long time facehugger hatched aboard vessel aliens hypersleep containers sent escape pod sent nearest planet fiorina ore refinery turned maximum security prison however facehugger managed attach one cryotubes sent escape pod unfortunately landing one survivors aliens killed ripley discovered inmates taken back refinery course need carrier facehugger attachs dog came team inmates ripley revived asks see ship seeing mysterious acideaten section ripley asks see dead bodies cremated cremation scene one powerful impressive alien films featuring monologue dillon charles dutton prisoner found god movie cuts back forth ceremony dogs demise one memorable moments speech reflects exactly going dog alien succeeds fincher normally injects lot symbolism films easily see becoming next stanley kubrick alfred hitchcock fact mixture fincher knows exactly film film figure one directors complete control films alien riddled symbolic speeches metaphorical images fincher creates best scenes entire alien franchise many people criticized finchers filming death scene ripley reveal nothing saying looking fake enjoy relish portrayal showing ripley fall slow motion nice touch actually showing hit vat iron great deal symbolism derived feel would spoiled mood entire film actually shown splash molten iron however people seem want witness ripley die creates paradox character didnt want see die killed one surprises film dont plan spoiling review every alien film comes several memorable moments seem stick forever alien course moment alien burst kanes stomach aliens showdown alien ripley machine alien several memorable terrific shot involving alien ripley ripley pushed wall alien stands inches away doesnt kill shocker later leads surprise ending fincher apparently loves use closeups actors faces michael douglas clown faceoff game style shaving actors hair thing look faces many critics didnt like actors bald makes complete sense taken context plot alien works take context story try compare predecessors finchers turn seems bit gloomy dark though thats always bad thing plot pretty much rehash first two films major twists setup several different characters one one picked however first two tons arsenal especially camerons film alien takes place planet devoid human life except rundown prison result weapons found creates lot tension although must admit fincher could added lot suspense alien film alien worst series extremely wellmade motion picture lot merits unfortunate thing surrounding second sequel onedimensional characters never really emotionally involved screen characters hardcore criminals really could care less despite ripley central figure thats important care even though began act like one guys technical side film remarkable better two previous versions camerons version pumped action film massive artillary fincher uses brilliant camera angles terrific lighting moody sets cinematography alex thomson well done terrific chase sequence towards end movie confusion ending draws viewer confused actors chased around yellows reds oranges lights create dark mood create lot suspense shadows dance walls yet shadows could easily alien alien different predecessors time around swiftness alien quite intense camera likes take perspective alien racing characters sets quite incredible reminiscient nostromo alien narrow corridors labrynthine hallways well constructed sets appear future far future one set pieces even aids destruction alien nothing surprising sigourney weaver turns yet another good performance equaling portrayal ripley aliens snubbed oscars one mainly film critical bomb reactions far realistic film crying loss little child risked life saving previous encounter quite touching really charles dutton strong performance one inmates brink actually caring charles dance turns nice lowkey performance result cared immediately lance henriksen makes brief appearance bishop ii entertaining aliens rest cast pretty stale though pete postlethwaite sticks due recent turns usual suspects lost world alien rated strong violence language sex although flaws alien highly entertaining rich symbolism film reminds much fun spot metaphorical images throughout movie kubrick may moral message throughout films fincher relies cinematic devices bring meanings film like finchers reminds us okay film sacrifice quality quantity final scene fact tells us society become critical things may happen look little fake whenever something looks fake screen immediately point mistake perhaps isnt mistake

beliefs one see director tony kaye wanted name removed sorta american history good movie moved could lot better problem seems cut claims potential somewhere claims lies tony kaye cut true cut viewed norton ordered another cut thus although aimed directing credit go alan smithee resident name film disowned director wasnt allowed grounds disown film badmouth really thats macguffin one really wanted film good given alan smithee sign disapproval kayes right par even hes referring normal par rather personal par right thing late yet still gets point across intelligently backs story message one cannot enwrapped ones beliefs pain suffering occur literally said narration unfortunately even isnt perfect least avery brooks turns norton beaten raped prison asks anything hes done made life better realy hits nerve derek also audience

ending law hollywood films else must ending even based true story true story hasnt yet ended must supply ending false one ending nevertheless hell civil action even sly witty grisham works put

filter many wont bitch essentially genuine fact ends actuality wrong rather zallian chosen last half hour adandon traditional lawyer story chose part story one lawyer one jan schlictman john travolta whos shown opening throughout movie heartless brilliant lawyer brilliant hes manipulative always wins wishes make jan end truth change although nicely done full see suffering personal crisis travolta pretty good job depicting change heart end dont fully believe think problem made decision film choses odd angle go noble one one gives films conclusion incompleteness opening film see old schtick manipulating courts winning cases effortlessly discussing heard radio interview great job much cares cases short hes full bullshit know film takes case hardly desired town several children died mysteriously lukemia source illness seems local factory may may dumping waste river point one usual criteria jan points wickedly dead wounded children arent nearly sympathetic struck midst success point two several lawyers turning jan changes mind muddled scene stops car bridge looks feeling sense overachievement team lawyers tony shalhoub zeljko ivanek accountant william macy head town battle

criticized film overlydramatic suppose like grisham novel wouldnt change jan handled way instead change heart automatically perceived good hes seen still full bullshit doesnt take stock cares partners causes lose money noteriaty lawyer field wants help people town instead seen good nature sure bring final half tries redeem must point making zallians mind follows series scenes merely see making personal stands beliefs though changed considerably opening moments hes seen speeding back forth town wishes employ thusly receiving two speeding tickets still feel big change life hes rich esteemed anymore films final title card witty actuality shallow fault closure court case still going know personal story feels like needs either another chapter another angle final one need feel like character really made big change life story story strife like one town could inspire whopping change personal life feels like half maybe even less travolta great job though never truly memorable performance rather zallian whose final chapter needs rewrite though engrossing drama one best year fact one best lawyer films period reason recognizes court trial defended prosecuted rather lawyers knights battle eachother learn company almost positively blame deaths town reason cant blamed best prosecution find duvalls facher brilliant character magnificent job portraying man almost easy overlook subtley great facher seen elderly man goofy eccentric carrying broken brown bag stickers eating lunches paper bags making point take time day listen radio scold anyone interupts look deeper see master work evil manipulative nature hidden eccentricities others upon difficult hell clearly generalize way thats liked film hard put pointer never see exactly film land even credits roll still arent sure make

bought novel lloyd alexander called black cauldron sword sorcery tale studio bringing book screen studios fondest dream miller entitled executive producer promised would proved projects micheal eisner executives arrived disney animation studio animators struggling complete black cauldron time things gone really rocky animation department many studios old men retired died therefore animators suffered hard time making film originally budgeted million costs raised million constant changes everything finally released june black cauldron greeted praising reviews critics somehow film flopped film rated pg film although disneyfied lloyd alexanders chronicles prydain film based much scarier darker disneys previous efforts rescuers fox hound probably many people considered scary stayed away addition critics rejected heart unmemorable compared disney animated features whatever real reason black cauldron financial disaster grossing million failure film grounded studios animation department exiled animation team annex buildings nearby glendale seemed like animated features would longer become part studios reputation next two disney animated features great mouse detective oliver company although little lighthearted black cauldron didnt much better although oliver company grossed much black cauldron great mouse detective little mermaid studio regain reputation successful animated features black cauldron rereleased cities temporary time title taran magic cauldron finally studio locked film film vault denied ever even released might ask black cauldron really bad movie people seen film didnt think fact many people calls buena vista home video requesting film course denied seemed like black cauldron would never released video september disney released black cauldron video united kingdom people imported video england converted ntsc including hadnt seen film yet included got quite treat people bootleg copies black cauldron noticed scene horned king raises army deathless warriors seconds ghoulish looking skeletons slightly trimmed film would get rating uk rating means universal suitable ages kinda like version somewhere online team diehard black cauldron fans signed petition said bring back black cauldron disney finally decided release video united states time rumors online made video would trimmed like uk video would get rating would add songs rumors put rest walt disney company announced black cauldron would released pg rated version even still finally released us reaction mixed felt indeed cut felt wasnt minor criticisms seemed laughable since film absent thirteen years finally available saw movie first time converted ntsc video didnt expect much fact heard many mediocre things didnt think film would ever good film much surprise saw first minutes film asking film everyone saw one flopped box office one critics filmgoers alike called bad movie doesnt seem like instead classic right film wonderful cast characters theres taran grant bardsley assistant pig keeper would rather warrior pigkeeper storys hero critics said taran likeable opposite true brave loyal eventually learns lesson friendship later theres likeable character hes likeable character film theres gurgi john biner lovable little uh thing remains loyal taran even though dont quite hit first another likeable character bad guy comic henchman dwarf named creeper phil fondacairo loyal films imaginative sinister villain horned king voiced gruesomely john hurt yet also fears neck characters including sidekicks spunky sweet princess named eilonwy comic bard fflewdurr flamm three comically wicked witches hide dark secret although pleasant likeable arent quite well rounded story adventurous one quest involving mystical pig hen wen black cauldron army deathless ones everything hooking opening spectacular finale elmer bernsteins music also tells story perfectly dark yet calming manner animation surprisingly good considering film created darkest time studios even though occasional effects quite good like ground opening black cauldron rises earth animation overall top notch overall film entertaining endeavor fans unfamiliar lloyd alexander chronicles prydain get kick one except young kids extremely scary scenes darker disneys films although consider stampede sequence lion king frollo observing esmeralda fires hell hunchback notre dame scary main reason film rated pg fans familiar lloyd alexander series recognize differences novel movie even though doesnt ingredients true disney film film classic right deserves far better chance given better chance finally come whatever reason black cauldron big failure seems disappeared film finally achieved place among disneys proudest achievements cant help think though whatever would happened black cauldron

investigation father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne mysterious appearance bleeding statue father kiernan investigator made career disproving supposed religious signs time believes something bleeding

witnesses stigmata attacks dedicates finding going eventually begins suspect boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce concealing something could bring catholic church turns dead priest working translation fifth gospel excommunicated new rupert wainwright music video mean film stigmata sort film starts ok gets worse indeed would good music video interesting five minutes im sure wainwright trying prove endless parade slowmotion doubleexposure extreme closeups whoaaaaaa fact swelled head director hollywood yes film school camera trickery interesting little eventually becomes headacheinducing film needed second audio track played dialogue wainwright screaming audience see look im excellent director maybe hed explain decided start half scenes slowmotion shots water dripping reverse included random superfluous shots egg frying ooh scary underlying meaning behind camera trickery didnt see thought safe get involved story comes doubleexposure shot two patricia arquettes collapsing bed reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh superfluous camera trickery wouldnt bother stigmata story characters remotely engaging though wainwrights vanity certainly doesnt help seem given nearly unworkable script plot continuity character development need case point frankie page character assume supposed identify sympathize arent given back story character reason like extent character development seems hardworking hairdresser somehow afford cavernous apartment top floor building shes kind cute lets start bleeding fact shes clearly brightest bulb drawer doesnt help either according frankie page first thing receiving mysterious wounds wrists back go clubbing sure makes sense arquette byrne pryce give old college try characters onedimensional appear sleepwalking scenes arquette byrne probably supposed sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat setup romantic subplot clumsily handled almost reaches point becoming laughable even though frankie pages life falling apart eyes still finds time hit priest wanders hair salon even curiously seems interested advances father andrews religious doubt pops suddenly seems silly dramatic pryce may well wear curled mustache cackle ill get pretty depth cardinal houseman afforded trust im revealing anything telling pryce turns villain whats worse faced dull characters prospect annoying camera tricks loud music jammed throats contend story starts one direction veers another another ends totally incomprehensible first film doesnt even bother explain simple plot details frankie get stigmata merely touching rosary come atheist like chosen since father andrew mentions devout believers ever received stigmata actually im sure frankie posessed supposedly stigmata occurs one posessed holy spirit film later posessed dead priest later evil spirit think one answer question course simple possessing entity scene determined whichever effects flashy camera work mr wainwright wants use time furthermore ending ridiculously neat little wrapup filmmakers compound problem ultimately turning film diatribe catholic church research gospel st thomas youll find suppressed church film seems claim readily available local library theres nothing catholics need worry though stigmatas religion offbase cant confused anything remotely resembling real catholic church wanted portray catholic priests mobsters gone allout equipped sharkskin suits tommy guns would far interesting im catholic fact care much catholic church cartoonish misrepresentation film considered realistic means rare see film fails many levels stigmata thoughtprovoking though would like definitely scary though pretends im sure tried pass horror film absolutely nothing scary story maybe attempt cover fact none scenes dramatic weight whatsoever initial shock seeing arquette covered blood dulled fact happens like many films mtv generation one suffers overkill much overdone stigmata eventually effect audience leaving us pick films many flaws im also still trying figure quotation take gospel st thomas earthshattering finally hear saying sounds like something every fiveyearold learns first day sunday school means flash whole film really much ado nothing dog days summer usually produce one monstrous dog stigmata

businessman gabriel byrne actually possessed devil assassination attempt businessman crazed former priest leads girl satan christine york robin tunney recognizing elements murdered daughter christine including ownership music box apparently jericho swears protect devil faction priests looking kill many problems film hard know begin starting concept casting arnold role like mistake begin schwarzenegger persona actor putting role contradicts usual strong personality bad idea arnold neither dramatic range speaking ability pull character tormented conflicting emotions words trying give dimension mistake harrison ford mel gibson even bruce willis could played role theyve played noble flawed heroes schwarzenegger several scenes attempt establish jerichos character one contemplating suicide another crying loss wife daughter even one devil tries tempt revealing christines location offering old life back none scenes really work arnie isnt task filmmakers would better making jericho strong confident character like terminator example likes schwarzenegger excelled one isnt believable way arnold plays supporting cast tries hardest gabriel byrne makes impact prince darkness hes suave confident acts like one would expect devil act problem script things make sense later undermines powerful villain byrne outperforms arnold every scene together including aforementioned temptation bit problematic causes audience start unthinkable root devil byrnes speech bible overrated actually starts make sense mainly arnolds attempts refuting mostly tis variety feeble best problem arnold win end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick tries liven things comic asides like bad action movie sidekicks disappears hour robin tunney isnt given much except look scared fact supporting players good actors none save byrne given anything interesting performances aside would really hard enjoy film matter starred action blockbuster surprise worst thing script starts totally confusing explained much utterly ridiculous devil coming new years eve exactly years year devil isnt turns nutty priest accidentally read upside real year add beginning youve got dont buy explanation youre alone convoluted silly time method jericho locates christine york equally ludicrous shes christine see lives new york see werent bad enough theres plenty bothersome stuff film isnt explained satan kill everyone passes street comes snuffing one drunk excop hes powerless impervious one kind bullet come cant control jericho christine gregorian monks deal time zones prophecies clumsy attempt joke made never actually explained usually sort thing wouldnt matter schwarzenegger flick mean dont get started time paradoxes offered terminator movies time plot inconsistencies stand even usual action rarely exciting several predictable horror film clich present end days complete old black cat hiding cabinet bit ever find cat gets formulaic possible uninterested scared close eyes precise moment boo come predictions rarely wrong grandiose action sequences utterly charmless partially dont care characters due scripts pathetic attempts characterization setup also dont make sense theres scene schwarzenegger gets thrown around room little old lady good chuckles much else supposedly believe super strength virtue controlled satan script never sets scene merely silly none terribly exciting action sequences badly framed often hard tell happening first place mention theyre edited fullon incomprehensible mtv quickcut style scratching head rather saying wow cool end days silly confusing also distinctly unpleasant watch devil apparently doesnt operate subtle illconvincepeopletokilleachother fashion outlined bible instead enjoys killing people gruesomely broad daylight doesnt make awfully predictable sort also means single scene end days goes without unnecessarily graphic violence odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit scratching head violence supposed shocking good idea throw much movie audience goes numb scenes arent connected reasonable means lot time stuff gets blown people get killed idea reasons hell reasons lets blow stuff isnt cool nope long shot film thoroughly unwatchable dull interminable unrelenting stupidity perhaps arnold needs make movies james cameron revive career happening hack peter hyams end days might camp value didnt top overly pious

means much many people calibrated creativity child masterful original works art mix moving stories astonishing special effects time still hold pretty darn well young seen star wars theater original release doesnt make less dedicated contrary star wars trilogy empire strikes back particular three items short list love movies heard george lucas would making first trilogy ninefilm series got exited first saw screenshots film well year ago embarked yearlong drool anticipation first previews released last thanksgiving ready see film hype insane marketing campaign lucasfilms secretive snobbery picture last weeks picture opened multitudes fans waited outside theaters stood boiling sun days advance first ones theater tired hearing tired seeing cardboard cutouts characters whenever went kfc taco bell wanted see movie reader misunderstand antihype reaction hype unavoidable understand accept hype happens prequel widely beloved films time get released five minutes phantom menace knew problem jedi knights asked churning stale dialogue machinegun rapidity arent characters developed adventures special effects shot nearly every frame entire film questions early later asked wheres magic first three films looking watch every fifteen minutes end film tired maddened depressed george lucas funneled wonderful movies pointless mindless summer blockbuster phantom menace star wars film take away title jedi talk force youre left easily one vacuous special effects movies time embarrassment looked desperately scene character explored new theme examined special effects shot isnt used theyre token attempts fact george lucas created simultaneously abysmally bad excuse movie pretty good showcase digital effects wanted see didnt want leave phantom menace headache bitter taste mouth story centers mostly around quigon jinn liam neeson looking lost confused apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor scarcely line film attempts liberate people planet naboo naboo victim bureaucratic war trade federation contact naboo queen amidala natalie portman teenage ruler truly cares people picking jar jar binks completely cgi character voiced ahmed best head tatooine meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd mother pernilla august quigon knows force strong young anakin jedi knights take boy journeys bad guys darth maul darth sidious neither enough lines register characters isnt anything particularly wrong story looking synopsis form way lucas handled however unsatisfactory first dont learn one single thing quigon jinn one thing life like film well imagine didnt one thats feels like plot device probably explains neeson looks hopeless role hes recently retired film dont blame honestly obiwan character really looking forward learning even less interesting mcgregor lines anyone hoping see engaging young actor great performance urged look elsewhere since two men focus phantom menace lucas served us big emotional void centerpiece movie things start pick characters reach tatooine young anakin perhaps truly fleshedout character film lloyd thoughtful job role also hugely impressed sand speeder scene rarely action sequence fast exciting anakin says goodbye mother found moving also fairly good portman manages give little depth character depth written jar jar binks one annoying characters ive ever endure hes interesting humans soon relativelybrief segment tatooine back mindnumbing special effects depthless action scenes ive seen many movies qualify special effects extravaganzas phantom menace first one ive seen sick special effects fifteen minutes movie reason obvious george lucas restraint cant say didnt find effects original final battle darth maul obiwan quigon visually exceptional film also found effects deadening tiresome breaking point near end

omission gratuitous piece nonsense lynch wasnt even herberts book scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man front slobbering henchmen pulling heart plug surreal disturbing episode

warning spoilers included review doesnt really make much difference deep impact begins official summer movie season also brings back memories remember dantes peak came february months later volcano released first film smart exhilirating one best disaster films ever seen latter film incohesive mess defied logic wasted talent well deja vu two disaster films go head head competition time unfortunately first comet flick bad people may shy away armageddon upcoming cometdisaster released beginning july course general reaction audience oppposed mine minority stood side dantes peak watching deep impact began wonder anyone right mind could actually like film apparently many utterly baffles completely honest havent little fun watching disaster film entire life volcano implausibilities wazoo still rather fun watch deep impact doesnt implausibilities also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects poorly constructed plot thing gives half star

standard disaster film procedures one subplot worth mentioning jenny father jason maximilian schell touching relationship forms impending doom final moment involving two characters heartfelt emotional shame nothing else heartfelt course know comet impact surface title alone suggests previews actually show absoltuely tension drawn attempt stop comet know wont work director mimi leder came successful tries direction episodes hit television show er major film debut peacemaker pathetic heartless action film well time leder outdid creating film worse one suggestion ms leder please stay away big screen least action genre much blame placed leder directly pace disastrously throughout film given subtitles tell us much time passed goes months weeks hours literally feels like lapsed time taking place realtimeits boring course leder isnt blame screenwriters michael tolkin bruce joel rubin crafted simplistic story gets worse time starts promising soon turns deadly audience anyway chock full cheesy one liners know going sex anyone else school stupid characters might think back one subplots remotely interesting rest forgettable boring main plot outrageous cant figure film supposed action drama scifi put simply special effects film hit miss situation thats right miss hit scenes earth well done orbiting ship majestic comet huge mistake making laughable frightening concept even trying land comet preposterous enough thats forgiveable isnt forgiveable actually humans walk surface give break ya course much hyped collision comet earth well far spectacular makes independence day look brilliant water rushing towards land effective hits continent effects turn ridiculous cgi water used looks bad heard laughs audience shrieks fact may even recommend film want see bad effects actually get days think visual effects cant improved along comes film show really one thing struck wrong note concerning mimi leders direction also influences actors leder loves show actors faces moments terror reminded another action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger harlin succeeds shows faces victims realistic situations leder likes flaunt peoples fears via faces instead coming sympathetic leder seems sadist one moment astronaut flying space enough warrant response audience leder wants go farther shows us persons face drifting space one cheapest ways ellicit emotional response audience one going fooled another note leders film picks pace last fifteen minutes comet actually impacts pace pick emotional moments shown watch people cry loved ones obvious emotional mostly big trick rope viewers feeling characters didnt work anyway actors much given leoni bad boys tvs naked truth best film given meatiest role character made stronger leonis presence grow care robert duvall energetic fun watch character turned shreds plot elijah wood also comes rather successfully still hasnt many good roles wood stick drama talented stuff vanessa redgrave barely acknowledgeable performance enhanced strong presence screen maximilian schell distracting provide nice humor morgan freeman infinitely better gives one shallow performances date quite remarkable leelee sobieski could better think suffered poorly written character special note go ron eldard denise crosby eldard good role limited plot crosby special personally tasha yar tvs star trek next generation seeing one highlights film overall talented cast virtually wasted deep impact rated disaster related elements brief language one worst films year omen things come summer could one worst ever luckily xfiles movie coming hopefully armageddon successful shame film successfully isnt worth much costing nearly million special effects done illustrious ilm huge shocker score composed oscarwinner james horner titanic one

friend film school made two minutelong film one classes includes staged anal rape scene done two guys shot shadow incident banana used instrument penetration sick watching one admittingly hysterical moments ive ever witnessed sure may bad taste hell bad taste something may offensive riotously amusing rest theres caligula film features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio sexes elaborate lengthy orgies greasedup fist forced mans rear wine poured man whos urinary tracts tied penis chopped fed hungry dogs etc etc etc could well respectable film could following occurred events graphically shot clear view tone trying shock comically well show historical accuracy film million dollar production lavish sets rather impressive cast whopping hour running time produced funded none bob guccione owner penthouse magazine caligula comes across hysterical dramatic picture since plan outer space underneath theres sense everything film accurate justified also brilliantly entertaining really fact film features aforementioned disgusting moments actually believes dramatic weaponry film discarded content film never old cliche goes bash film content glancing biggest obvious problem caligula thats nothing overdramaticized bullshit start finish without second credibility mammoth running time caligula allegedly tells true story evil roman emporer name man insanely decadent assasination came blessing guess even though almost every single roman emporer assasinated well much reasons film opens wrong note course quote mark appearing image graces screen using overused passage shall profit man gain whole world dlose soul depite fact opening scene film emporer emporer fucking around sister field suppose one lose soul one soul first place plot incomprehensibly done anyone else make caligula disastrously played great malcom mcdowell performance opposite performance clockwork orange next line throne cant wait current emporer tiberius peter toole ditto performance lawrence arabia grandfather die kills ascends throne abuses position marries woman helen mirren retains dignity actor exactly acting doesnt sleep sister dreadful teresa ann savoy pretty naked willing hop sack mac anyone asks hop abuses position little little little believe invades england killed filler instead recounting life supposed guccione claims ultimate portrait decadent pagan rome complete orgies vicious deaths lots nudity instead historical accurate film really really wants instead becomes gucciones twisted masturbatory image could like oh isnt great loved sex killed people disgustingly wouldnt great could make couple bucks selling shit accuracy even though blatantly real bad porn ive completely convinced mean show roman orgy spend good ten minutes examining every single facet makes disgusting vile whatever adjective want use describe film film entire feel going isnt felt also sloppiest expensive movie time sets lavish blatantly innacurate wonder historian wanting name film explains doesnt matter since cinematography dark wonder light meter used making dark ugly plain dark camera operation also worst ive ever seen entire life film hold record unnecessary zooms one single shot ever often camera lose subjects pan around till find focus editing sloppy scenes absolutely impossible follow writer speak hell mean adapted original screenplay gore vidal nevertheless dialogue shit laughably bad cant good faith believe anyone iq could say straight face favorite line caligula inquires doctor health dying tiberius could go moment care could last year music film mostly prokofiev khachaturian use gorgeous adagio spartacus phrygia ad nauseum used attempt give film emotion instead feels shipped elsewhere orgy scenes one infamous lesbo scene penthouse pets lori wagner aneeka dilorenzo result reshoots guccione obviously removed everything else film adds embrassment every five seconds film cuts random nudity afraid audience would forget film rated john gielgud represents voice sanity walking around brief role constantly mantra im going kill agent im going kill agent hours making caligula exciting enriching three hour college lecture class twice deliriously annoying guccione pursuit historical accuracy instead made film painstaking arduous task watch entirety doubt anyone sit hour without irreversible psychological damage throughout entire film presence guccione easily felt standing edge screen pretentiously looking upon us saying look get away dont like youre prig worse know nothing history uh huh theres clear difference historical accuracy something thats artistically good film showed roman decadence something perhaps liberating could last would probably make good film using historical accuracy licence get away kind disgustingfordisgustingnesssake acts total total bullshit say guccione makers film lost kind touch either entertainment eroticism developed pathetic sadistic taste judging film theres film came called cook thief wife lover magnifcent film legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren deals graphic sex heartstopping violence gore even little cannibalism good measure film never patronized viewers also handled way shocking yes also bizarre way entertaining totally involving real characters real situation best passion right amount restraint get fact going offensive
